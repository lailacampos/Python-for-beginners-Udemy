# Decorators with optional arguments

# Reminder: When a decorator uses arguments, an outer function needs to be added (one more layer)

# Since the function to decorate is only passed in directly if the decorator is called without arguments,
# the function must be an optional argument
# This means that the decorator arguments must all be specified by keyword

# Boilerplate:

# 1 - If name has been called without arguments, the decorated function will be passed in as _function.
# If it has been called with arguments, then _func will be None, and some of the keyword arguments may have been
# changed from their default values. The * in the argument list means that the remaining arguments canâ€™t be called
# as positional arguments.
# def name(_function=None, *, keyword1=value1, keyword2=value2, ...): # 1
#     def decorator_name(function):
#         #... Create and return wrapper function
#
#     # In this case, the decorator was called with arguments. Return a decorator function that can read and return
#     # a function.
#     if _function is None:
#         return decorator_name  # 2
#     else:
#
#         #In this case, the decorator was called without arguments. Apply the decorator to the function immediately.
#         return decorator_name(_function)  # 3

from functools import wraps


# If repeat is called WITHOUT arguments, the original function will be passed in as _function (the keywords arguments
# have default values in case they are not specified)
# If it's called WITH arguments, that means the keywords will be specified while _function will not, therefore _function
# will default to None.
